Lecture Hall Air and Light Control System


The "Lecture Hall Air and Light Control System" is an IoT project aimed at improving environmental monitoring and control in lecture halls. It employs sensors like the DHT11 for temperature and humidity and an analog gas sensor for detecting gas levels, particularly focusing on gas leakage. Data collected by these sensors is wirelessly transmitted using an ESP8266 module and the Blynk platform. Alongside monitoring, the system includes a relay for controlling lecture hall lighting remotely, facilitating automation based on environmental conditions or user preferences. This integrated IoT solution enhances comfort, safety, and energy efficiency by providing real-time monitoring and remote control capabilities.
